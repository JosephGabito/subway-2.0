Hide the content of your website to non-logged in visitors and only displays them to logged in users.

== Description ==

<h4>Quick Overview</h4>

Subway is a small plugin for WordPress that allows you <strong>hide the content</strong> of your website to <strong>non-logged in</strong> visitors and only displays them to logged in users.

<h4>Description</h4>

This plugin redirects the users to the provided login page with a login form that allows them to type their username/email and password combination.

It validates the users’ credentials and displays a set of configurable messages if there are errors such as invalid username, empty username, wrong password, and etcetera.

The plugin has settings inside the Administration Panel (‘Settings’ > 'Subway') that allows you to configure where you want the user to be taken after he/she has successfully logged in, this can be a page, a custom URL, or just the default behavior.

<h4>Caveats</h4>

Subway is only built for WordPress website owners to redirect non-logged in users to a custom login form. This plugin is not a replacement for Membership websites where a complex set of configurations are allowed. There are no payments model, subscriptions, and role types.

Subway is good for Private Intranet Websites where authentication is required.
